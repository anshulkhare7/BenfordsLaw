Significant Accounting Policies to the Abridged Financial Statements

Note 1   General Information and Significant Accounting Policies
1.1		    General Information
		Reliance Communications Limited (“RCOM” or “the Company”), founded by the late Shri Dhirubhai H. Ambani, is the
    flagship company of the Reliance Group. The Company is registered under the Companies Act,1956 having Registered
    Office at H Block, 1st Floor, Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City, Navi Mumbai 400710 and its securities listed on the BSE
    Limited and the National Stock Exchange of India Limited.

  RCOM is India’s foremost and truly integrated telecommunications service provider in the private sector. RCOM has
		
  established a pan-India, next generation, integrated (wireless and wireline), convergent (long distance, voice, data, video
  and internet) digital network that is capable of supporting best-of-class services spanning the entire communications value
  chain. RCOM owns and operates the next generation IP enabled connectivity infrastructure, comprising of fibre optic cable
  systems in India and globally.
1.01		   a.   Basis of Preparation of Financial Statements
			The Financial Statements are prepared under historical cost convention/ fair valuation, under the scheme approved
    by the Hon’ble High Court, in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in India and in
    compliance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013
    (“the Act”) read with Rule 3 of the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, the Companies (Indian
    Accounting Standards) Amendment Rules, 2016 and other provisions of the Act, to the extent notified and applicable
    as well as applicable guidance notes and pronouncements of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the
    ICAI).
			These financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2017 are the first financial statement that the Company has
    prepared under Ind AS. For all periods upto and including the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company prepared its
    financial statements in accordance with the accounting standards notified under Section 133 of the Act, read together
    with Rule 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Previous GAAP’) used for its
    statutory reporting requirements in India immediately before adopting Ind AS.
			All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non-current as per the Company’s normal operating cycle
    and other criteria as set out under Ind AS and in the Schedule III to the Act. Based on the nature of the services and
    their realisation in cash and cash equivalent, the Company has ascertained its operating cycle as twelve months for
    the purpose of current or non-current classification of assets and liabilities.
   Pursuant to first proviso to sub-section (1) of section 136 of the Act read with Rule 10 of Companies (Accounts)
			
   Rules, 2014, the Company has prepared abridged standalone Ind AS financial statements. In order to giving a fair
   presentation of financial statement, the format of the abridged financial statement in AOC-3 has been suitably
   modified in line with the requirements of Division II of Schedule III of Ind AS.
		b.          Recent Accounting Developments

			           Standards issued but not yet effective:
			In March 2017, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (the MCA), Government of India (GoI) issued the Companies (Indian
    Accounting Standards) (Amendments) Rules, 2017, notifying amendments to Ind AS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’
    and Ind AS 102 ‘Share-based payment.’
			The amendments are applicable to the Company with effect from April 1, 2017.

			           Amendment to Ind AS 7: Statement of Cash Flows
			The amendment to Ind AS 7 requires the entities to provide disclosures that enable the users of the financial
    statements to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from the financing activities, including both changes arising from
    cash flows and non-cash changes, suggesting inclusion of a reconciliation between the opening and closing balances
    in the balance sheet for liabilities arising from the financing activities, to meet the disclosure requirement.

			           Amendment to Ind AS 102: Share based payments
			The amendment to Ind AS 102 provides specific guidance as to the measurement of cash-settled awards, modification
    of cash-settled awards and awards that include a net settlement feature in respect of withholding taxes. It clarifies
    that the fair value of cash-settled awards is determined on the basis consistent with that used for equity settled
    awards. Market-based performance conditions and non-vesting conditions are reflected in the ‘fair values’, but non-
    market performance conditions and service vesting conditions are reflected in the estimate of the number of awards
    expected to vest. Also, the amendment clarifies that if the terms and conditions of the cash-settled share-based
    payment transaction are modified with the result that it becomes an equity-settled share-based payment transaction,
    the transaction is accounted for as such from the date of the modification.

Significant Accounting Policies to the Abridged Financial Statements

			Further, the amendment requires the award that includes the net settlement feature in respect of withholding taxes
    to be treated as the equity-settled in its entirety. The cash payment to the tax authority is treated as if it was part
    of an equity settlement.

1.02		   Functional Currency and Presentation Currency
		       These financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (“Rupees” or “`“) which is functional currency of the Company.
         All amounts are rounded off to the nearest crore, unless stated otherwise.
1.03		   Use of Estimates
		The preparation and presentation of Financial Statements requires estimates and assumptions to be made that affect the
   reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities on the date of the Financial Statements
   and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Difference between the actual results
   and estimates is recognised in the period in which the results are known/ materialised. Estimates and underlying assets are
   reviewed on periodical basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised prospectively.
		The preparation of financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates which, by definition, will seldom equal the
   actual results. The management also needs to exercise judgement in applying the accounting policies.
		This note provides an overview of the areas that involved a higher degree of judgement or complexity, and of items which
   are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different than those originally
   assessed. Detailed information about each of these estimates and judgements is included in relevant notes together with
   information about the basis of calculation for each affected line item in the financial statements.
		       Critical estimates and judgements
		The Company has based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were
   prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes
   or circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Company. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when
   they occur.
		The areas involving critical estimates or judgements pertaining to useful life of property, plant and equipment including
   intangible asset, current tax expense and tax payable, recognition of deferred tax assets for carried forward tax losses, fair
   value of unlisted securities, impairment of trade receivables and other financial assets and measurement of defined benefit
   obligation (Note 2.15). Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated. They are based on historical experience and
   other factors, including expectations of future events that may have a financial impact on the Company and that are
   believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
		       (i)	Useful life of Property, Plant and Equipment including intangible asset: Residual values, useful lives and methods of
              depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if
              appropriate.
		       (ii)   Taxes: The Company provides for tax considering the applicable tax regulations and based on probable estimates.
			Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns giving due considerations to tax laws and establishes
    provisions in the event if required as a result of differing interpretation or due to retrospective amendments, if any.
			The recognition of deferred tax assets is based on availability of sufficient taxable profits in the Company against
    which such assets can be utilized.
		       (iii)	Fair value measurement and valuation process: The Company measured financial assets and liabilities, if any, at fair
                value for financial reporting purposes.
		       (iv)	Trade receivables and Other Financial Assets: The Company follows a ‘simplified approach’ (i.e. based on lifetime
               Expected Credit Loss (“ECL”)) for recognition of impairment loss allowance on Trade receivables. For the purpose of
               measuring lifetime ECL allowance for trade receivables, the Company estimates irrecoverable amounts based on the
               ageing of the receivable balances and historical experience. Further, a large number of minor receivables are grouped
               into homogeneous groups and assessed for impairment collectively. Individual trade receivables are written off when
               management deems them not to be collectable.
		       (v)	Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits): The Company’s obligation on account of gratuity and compensated absences
              is determined based on actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ
              from actual developments in the future. These include determination of the discount rate, future salary increases and
              mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, these liabilities are highly
              sensitive to changes in these assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
			The parameter subject to frequent changes is the discount rate. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the
    management considers the interest rates of government bonds in currencies consistent with the currencies of the
    post-employment benefit obligation.


                                                                                                                                   87

Significant Accounting Policies to the Abridged Financial Statements

			The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality tables in India. Those mortality tables tend to change only
    at interval in response to demographic changes. Future salary increases and gratuity increases are based on expected
    future inflation rates.
		       (vi)	Non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
               carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the
               asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.
		       (vii)	Provisions and contingent liabilities are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best
                estimates.
1.04		   Property, Plant and Equipment
		       (i)	Property, plant and equipment (PPE) are stated at cost net of Modvat/ Cenvat less accumulated depreciation,
              amortisation and impairment loss, if any. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future
              economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Company.
		       (ii)	Cost of an item of PPE comprises of its purchase price including import duties and non refundable purchase taxes after
               deducting trade discounts and rebates, any directly attributable cost of bringing the item to its working condition for its
               intended use and present value of estimated costs of dismantling and removing the item and restoring the site on which
               it is located.

		       (iii)	As per Para 46A of Accounting Standard 11, ‘The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates‘, related to acquisition
                of depreciable assets pursuant to the notifications dated December 29, 2011 and August 9, 2012 issued by Ministry
                of Corporate Affairs (MCA), under the Companies (Accounting Standard) (Second Amendment) Rules 2011, the cost
                of depreciable capital assets includes foreign exchange differences arising on translation of long term foreign currency
                monetary items as at the balance sheet date in so far as they relate to the acquisition of such assets is capitalised
                and subsequently on adoption of Indian Accounting Standard also the same is allowed for the transactions recorded
                upto March 31, 2016.

		       (iv)	On transition to Ind AS, the Company has elected the option of fair value as deemed cost for certain Land and
               Buildings and Plant and Machinery, as on the date of transition. Other Tangible Assets are restated retrospectively.

		       (v)	In accordance with Ind AS, the Company has fair valued certain Properties, Plant and Equipment as on April 1, 2015
              using the following approach: Real Estate Assets of the Company have been fair valued adopting a combination of all
              the three approaches viz market, income and cost approach. Land is valued using replacement cost approach, certain
              buildings are valued using income approach and other buildings and improvements are fair valued using cost approach.
              CDMA Electronics have been fair valued using replacement cost approach.

		       (vi)	Depreciation is provided on Straight Line Method based on the useful life prescribed in Schedule II to the Act except
               in case of the following assets where useful life is different than those that are prescribed in Schedule II, based on
               technical evaluation.

		       (xii)	Expenses incurred relating to project, prior to commencement of commercial operations, are considered as project
                development expenditure and shown under Capital Work in Progress.

1.05		   Intangible Assets

		           Intangible assets acquired are measured on initial recognition at cost. Cost includes all direct costs relating to

               commencement of commercial operations, which is capitalised.

			Where the lessor effectively retains substantially all risks and benefits of the ownership of the leased assets, lease is
    classified as operating lease. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Profit and
    Loss.

		        (ii)	In respect of Finance Leases, the lower of the fair value of the assets and present value of the minimum lease rentals
                is capitalised as PPE with corresponding amount shown as the liabilities for the leased assets. The principal component
                in lease rental in respect of the above is adjusted against the liabilities for the leased assets and interest component
                is recognised as an expense in the year in which the same is incurred except in case of the assets used for capital
                projects where it is capitalised.

1.07		    Impairment of Non Financial Assets

		Intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are tested annually for impairment or more frequently if events or
   changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. Other assets are tested for impairment whenever events or
   changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An asset is treated as impaired when
   the carrying cost of assets exceeds its recoverable value. An impairment loss is charged to the Statement of Profit and
   Loss in the year in which an asset is identified as impaired. The impairment loss recognised in prior accounting period is
   increased/ reversed where there has been change in the estimate of recoverable value. The recoverable value is the higher
   of the assets’ net selling price and value in use.

1.08		    Inventories of Stores and Spares

		Inventories of stores and spares are accounted for at cost and all other costs incurred in bringing the inventory to their present
   location and condition, determined on weighted average basis or net realizable value, whichever is less.Net realizable value is
   the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

1.09		    Employee Benefits

		        Short term employee benefits

		All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short term employee
   benefits. These benefits include compensated absences such as paid annual leave and sickness leave. The undiscounted
   amount of short term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered by the employees are
   recognised as an expense during the period.


                                                                                                                                     89

		       Long term employee benefits

		       (i)    Defined contribution plan

			The Company’s contribution towards Employees’ Superannuation Plan is recognised as an expense during the period
    in which it accrues.

		       (ii)   Defined benefit plans

			Provident Fund

			Provident Fund contributions are made to a Trust administered by the Trustees. Interest payable to the Provident Fund
    members, shall not be at a rate lower than the statutory rate. Liability is recognised for any shortfall in the income of
    the fund vis-à-vis liability of the interest as per statutory rates to the members. The Company’s contribution towards
    Employees’ Provident Fund is recognised as an expense during the period in which it accrues.

			Gratuity Plan

			The Company’s gratuity benefit scheme is a defined benefit plan. The Company’s net obligation in respect of the
    gratuity benefit scheme is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in
    return for their services in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value,
    mortality rate and the fair value of plan assets is deducted. Mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality table
    in India.

			The present value of the obligation under such defined benefit plan is determined based on actuarial valuation using
    the Projected Unit Credit Method.

			Obligation is measured at present value of the estimated future cash flows. Discount rates used for determining
    present value of obligation under the defined benefit plan, are based on market yield of Government Securities as at
    the balance sheet date that have terms approximating to the terms of the related obligation.

			Remeasurement which comprise of actuarial gain and losses, the return of plan assets (excluding interest) and the
     effect of asset ceiling ( if any, excluding interest) are recognised in OCI.

			             Plan Assets of Defined Benefit Plans have been measured at fair value.

		       (iii) Other Long term employment benefits

			Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which
    the employee renders the related services are recognised as a liability at the present value of the defined benefit
    obligation at the balance sheet date, determined based on actuarial valuation using Projected Unit Credit Method.
    Discount rates used for determining the present value of the obligation under the defined benefit plan, are based
    on the market yields of Government Securities as at the Balance Sheet date. Remeasurement gain and losses is
    recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise.

1.10		   Borrowing Cost

		Borrowing costs attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the cost of
   such assets upto the commencement of commercial operations. A qualifying asset is one that necessarily takes substantial
   period of time to get ready for intended use. Other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the year in which they
   are incurred.

1.11		   Foreign Currency Transactions

		       (i)	Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rates prevailing at the time of the
              transaction.

		       (ii)   Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are restated at the year end rates.

		       (iii)	Non Monetary foreign currency items are carried at cost (i.e. translated using the exchange rates at the time of initial
                transactions).

		       (iv)	Exchange difference on monetary items is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they
               arises except for;

			             (a)	Exchange difference on foreign currency borrowings relating to depreciable capital asset is included in cost of
                     assets.

Significant Accounting Policies to the Abridged Financial Statements

			           (b)	Exchange difference on foreign currency transactions, on which receipt and/ or payments is not planned, initially
                   recognised in OCI and reclassified from equity to profit and loss on repayment of the monetary items.

		       (v)	All long term foreign currency monetary items consisting of loans taken before March 31, 2016 and which relate
              to the acquisition of depreciable capital assets at the end of the period/ year are restated at the rate prevailing at
              the balance sheet date. Exchange difference including attributable to the interest arising as a result is added to or
              deducted from the cost of the assets as per notification dated December 29, 2011 and August 9, 2012 issued by the
              Ministry of Company Affairs (MCA), Government of India and depreciated over the balance life of the capital asset.
              Exchange difference on other long term foreign currency loans is accumulated in “Foreign Currency Monetary Item
              Translation Difference Account (FCMITDA)” which will be amortized over the balance period of monetary assets or
              liabilities.

1.12		   Revenue Recognition

		       (i)	Revenue is recognised to the extent it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Company and revenue
              can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue is measured at the fair value of
              the consideration received or receivable.

		       (ii)	Revenue is recognised as and when the services are provided on the basis of actual usage of the Company’s network.
               Revenue on upfront charges for services with lifetime validity and fixed validity periods are recognised over the
               estimated useful life of the subscribers and specified fixed validity period, as appropriate. The estimated useful life is
               consistent with estimated churn of the subscribers.

		       (iii)	The Company sells rights of use (ROUs) that provide to the customers with network capacity, typically over a period
                of 5 to 20 years without transferring legal title or giving an option to purchase network capacity. Capacity services
                revenues are accounted as operating lease and recognised in the Company’s income statement over the life of the
                contract. Bills raised on the customers/ payments received from the customers for long term contracts and for which
                revenue is not recognised are included in deferred revenue. Revenue on non cancellable ROUs are recognised as
                licensing income over the period of the contract

		            Interest income on investment is recognised on time proportion basis. Interest income is accounted using the
         (iv)	
              applicable Effective Interest Rate (EIR), which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts
              over the expected life of the financial assets to that asset’s net carrying amount on initial recognition. Dividend is
              considered when right to receive is established. The Company recognises income from the units in the Fixed Income
              Schemes of Mutual Funds where income accrued is held till declaration or payment thereof for the benefit of the unit
              holders.

1.13		   Taxes on Income and Deferred Tax

		Income Tax comprises of current and deferred tax. It is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent
   that it relates to a business combination or to an item recognised directly in equity or OCI.

		Provision for income tax is made on the basis of taxable income for the year at the current rates. Tax expense comprises
   of current tax and deferred tax at the applicable enacted or substantively enacted rates. Current tax represents amount
   of Income Tax payable/ recoverable in respect of taxable income/ loss for the reporting period. Deferred tax represents
   the effect of temporary difference between carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statement and the
   corresponding tax base used in the computation of taxable income. Deferred tax liabilities are generally accounted for all
   taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax asset is recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carried forward
   of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against
   which such deductible temporary differences can be utilised.

		MAT (Minimum Alternate Tax) is recognized as an asset only when and to the extent it is probable evidence that the
   Company will pay normal income tax and will be able to utilize such credit during the specified period. In the year in which
   the MAT credit becomes eligible to be recognized as an asset, the said asset is created by way of a credit to the Statement
   of Profit and loss and is included in Deferred Tax Assets. The Company reviews the same at each balance sheet date and
   if required, writes down the carrying amount of MAT credit entitlement to the extent there is no longer probable that
   Company will be able to absorb such credit during the specified period.

1.14		   Government Grants
		Subsidies granted by the Government for providing telecom services in rural areas are recognised as other operating income
   in accordance with relevant terms and conditions of the scheme and agreement.
1.15		   Provisions including Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) and Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets
		Provisions involving substantial degree of estimation in measurement are recognised when there is a present obligation
   as a result of past events and it is probable that there will be an outflow of resources. Provisions are determined by

                                                                                                                                     91

Significant Accounting Policies to the Abridged Financial Statements

          discounting expected future cashflows at the pre tax rate that reflects current market assumptions of time value of money
          and risk specific to the liability. A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a
          present obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. When there is a possible obligation or a
          present obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.
          Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) relates to removal of electronics equipments when they will be retired from its active
          use. Provision is recognised based on the best estimate, of the management, of the eventual costs (net of recovery), using
          discounted cash flow, that relates to such obligation and is adjusted to the cost of such assets. Estimated future costs
          of decommissioning are reviewed annually and adjusted as appropriate. Changes in the estimated future costs or in the
          discount rate applied are added to or deducted from the cost of the asset. Contingent Assets are neither recognised nor
          disclosed in the financial statements of the Company.
1.16		    Earnings per Share
		In determining Earnings per Share, the Company considers net profit after tax and includes post tax effect of any
   exceptional item. Number of shares used in computing basic earnings per share is the weighted average number of the
   shares, excluding the shares owned by the Trust, outstanding during the period. Dilutive earning per share is computed
   and disclosed after adjusting effect of all dilutive potential equity shares, if any except when result will be anti - dilutive.
   Dilutive potential equity Shares are deemed converted as at the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date.
1.17		    Employee Stock Option Scheme
		In respect of stock options granted pursuant to the Company’s Employee Stock Option Scheme, fair value of the options
   is treated as discount and accounted as employee compensation cost over the vesting period. Employee compensation
   cost recognised earlier on grant of options is reversed in the period when the options are surrendered by any employee or
   lapsed as per the terms of the scheme.
1.18		    Treasury Equity
		The Company has created an Employee Stock Option Scheme Trust (ESOS Trust) for providing share-based payment
   to its employees. The Company uses ESOS Trust as a vehicle for distributing shares to employees under the employee
   remuneration schemes. The ESOS Trust buys shares of the Company from the market, for giving shares to employees. The
   Company treats ESOS Trust as its extension and shares held by ESOS Trust are treated as Treasury Equity.
		Own equity instruments that are reacquired (Treasury Equity) are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain
   or loss is recognised in Statement of Profit or Loss, on purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Company’s own equity
   instruments. Any difference between carrying amount and consideration, if reissued, is recognised in equity.
1.19		    Measurement of Fair value of financial instruments
		The Company’s accounting policies and disclosures require measurement of fair values for the financial instruments.
   The Company has an established control framework with respect to measurement of fair values. The management
   regularly reviews significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party information, such as broker
   quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the management assesses evidence obtained from third
   parties to support the conclusion that such valuations meet the requirements of Ind AS, including level in the fair value
   hierarchy in which such valuations should be classified.
		When measuring the fair value of a financial asset or a financial liability, the Company uses observable market data as far as
   possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation
   techniques as follows.
		        Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
		Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e.
   as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
		Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
		If inputs used to measure fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of fair value hierarchy, then fair
   value measurement is categorised in its entirety in the same level of fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that
   is significant to the entire measurement. The Company recognises transfers between levels of fair value hierarchy at the
   end of the reporting period during which the change has occurred. (Refer to note 2.10.1) for information on detailed
   disclosures pertaining to the measurement of fair values.”

1.20		    Financial Instruments

		A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity and a financial liability or equity
   instrument of another entity. Financial instruments also include derivative contracts such as foreign exchange forward
   contracts.

Significant Accounting Policies to the Abridged Financial Statements

		Financial Assets

		       (i)   Initial recognition and measurement

			All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value
    through Statement of Profit and Loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.

		(ii) Subsequent measurement

			Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Company’s business model for managing the asset and
    the cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Company classifies
    its debt instruments:

		       Financial Assets measured at amortised cost

		A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised cost if both the following conditions are met:

		a) Asset is held within a business model whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows.

		           ontractual terms of the asset give rise on specified dates to cash flows that are solely payments of principal and interest
         b) C
            (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. After initial measurement, such financial assets are subsequently measured
            at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any
            discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part of the EIR. EIR amortisation is included in
            finance income in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Losses arising from impairment are recognised in the Statement of
            Profit and Loss. This category generally applies to trade and other receivables.

		       Financial Assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI)

		A ‘debt instrument’ is classified as at the FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:

		       a) The objective of the business model is achieved both by collecting contractual cash flows and selling the financial assets.

		           he contractual cash flows of the assets represent SPPI: Debt instruments included within the FVTOCI category are
         b) T
            measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in the other
            comprehensive income (OCI). However, the Company recognizes interest income, impairment losses & reversals and
            foreign exchange gain or loss in the Statement of Profit and Loss. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss
            previously recognised in Other Comprehensive Income is reclassified from the equity to Statement of Profit and Loss.
            Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt instrument is reported as interest income using the EIR method.

		       Financial Assets measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL)

		Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified as
   at FVTPL. In addition, the Company may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost or
   FVTOCI criteria, as at FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if doing so reduces or eliminates a measurement or
   recognition inconsistency (referred to as ‘accounting mismatch’)

		Equity investments

		All equity investments in scope of Ind-AS 109, “Financial Instruments” are measured at fair value. Equity instruments
   which are held for trading are classified as at FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the company decides to classify
   the same either as at FVOCI or FVTPL. The Company makes such election on an instrument-by-instrument basis. The
   classification is made on initial recognition which is irrevocable. If the company decides to classify an equity instrument as
   at FVOCI, then all fair value changes on the instrument, excluding dividends, are recognized in the Other Comprehensive
   Income. There is no recycling of the amounts from Other Comprehensive Income to profit and loss, even on sale of
   investment. However, the Company may transfer the cumulative gain or loss within equity. Equity instruments included
   within the FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

		Also, Company has elected to apply the exemption available under Ind AS 101 to continue the carrying value for its
   investments in subsidiaries and associates as recognised in the financial statements as at the date of transition to Ind AS,
   measured as per the previous GAAP as at the date of transition”

		       Derecognition of Financial Assets

		A financial asset is primarily derecognised when: a) Rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or b) The
   Company has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay the received
   cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ‘pass-through’ arrangement and either(a) the Company
   has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Company has neither transferred nor retained
   substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.

                                                                                                                                     93

		        Impairment of Financial Assets

		The Company assesses on a forward looking basis the Expected Credit Losses (ECL) associated with its assets carried at
   amortised cost. The impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in the
   credit risk. In case of significant increase in credit risk, life time ECL is used; otherwise twelve month ECL is used. As a
   practical expedient, the Company uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its
   trade receivables, as permitted by Ind AS 109. Provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over the
   expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward-looking estimates. At every reporting date, the historical
   observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward-looking estimates are analysed.

		Financial Liabilities

		        (i)   Initial recognition and measurement

			All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, in the case of loans, borrowings and payables, net of directly
    attributable transaction costs. Financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings including
    bank overdrafts and derivative financial instruments.

		(ii) Subsequent measurement

			             The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described herein:

			Financial liabilities at fair value through Profit or Loss: Financial liabilities at fair value through Profit or Loss include
    financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair value through
    profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading if they are incurred for the purpose of repurchasing in
    the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Company that are not
    designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships as defined by Ind AS 109. Gains or losses on liabilities held
    for trading are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

   Financial Liabilities measured at amortised cost: After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are
			
   subsequently measured at amortised cost using the EIR method. Gains and losses are recognised in Statement of
   Profit and Loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through the EIR amortisation process. Amortised cost
   is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral part
   of the EIR. The EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

			Derecognition of Financial Liabilities

			A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When
     an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms
     of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition
     of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is
     recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

(v)   Spectrum Charges								
	DoT has, during the earlier years, issued demand on the Company for ` 1,758 crore towards levy of one time Spectrum Charges,
  being the prospective charges for holding CDMA spectrum beyond 2.5 MHz for the period from January 1, 2013 till the expiry
  of the initial terms of the respective Licenses. Based on a petition filed by the Company, the Hon’ble High Court of Kolkata,
  vide its order dated February 14 and April 19, 2013 has stayed the operation of such impugned demand till further order. The
  Company is of the view that the said demand, inter alia, is an alteration of financial terms of the licenses issued in the past and
  has also been advised so legally. Accordingly, no provision in this regard is required.
(vi) License Fees and Special Audit								
	Pursuant to the Telecom License Agreement, DoT directed audit of various Telecom companies including of the Company. The
  Special Auditors appointed by DoT were required to verify records of the Company for the years ended March 31, 2007 and
  March 31, 2008 relating to license fees and revenue share. The Company has received show cause notice dated January 31,
  2012 and subsequently, received demand note dated November 8, 2012 based on report of the Special Audit directed by
  DoT relating to alleged shortfall of license fees of ` 300 crore and interest thereon as applicable. The Company has challenged
  the said notices, inter alia demanding license fee on non telecom revenue based on Special Audit Report before the Hon’ble
  Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) and also before the Hon’ble High Court of Kerala. The impugned
  demand has been stayed by Hon’ble High Court of Kerala during the pendency of the Petition. Meanwhile, Hon’ble TDSAT vide
  its judgement dated April 23, 2015 has set aside all License fee related demands and directed DoT to rework the license fees
  payable by the operators for the past periods, in light of the findings, observations and directions made in the said judgement
  and to issue fresh demands, which the operators will pay within the time prescribed under the law. DoT has challenged the
  said TDSAT judgement in Hon’ble Supreme Court and has not revised/raised any fresh demand. The matter is pending before

    Hon’ble Supreme Court, though Hon’ble Supreme Court vide its order dated February 29, 2016 allowed DoT to raise demand
    as per its understanding but not to enforce the same till the appeals are finally decided by the Supreme Court. As per the
    judgement of Hon’ble TDSAT dated April 23, 2015 which is operative as on date and other judicial pronouncements directly
    applicable to the issues of License fee dues raised by Special Auditors, there shall not be any liability of License fee and hence,
    no provision is required in the accounts of the Company.

    2.10.1 Financial Instruments
	The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a
  current transaction between the willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
    The following methods and assumptions have been used to estimate the fair values:
	Fair value of cash and short-term deposits, trade and other short term receivables, trade payables, other current liabilities,
  short term loans from banks and other financial institutions approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short term
  maturities of these instruments
	Financial Instruments with fixed and variable interest rates are evaluated by the Company based on parameters such as interest
  rate and individual credit worthiness of the counterparty. Based on this evaluation, allowances are taken to account for the
  expected losses of these receivables.

                                                                                                                                    99

      Fair value hierarchy
      Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
	Level 2 - Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly
  (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
      Level 3 - Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
      There is no fair valuation of financial instruments.

     Market risk

	The Company also operates internationally and hence, a portion of the business is transacted in several currencies. Consequently,
  the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk to the extent that there is mismatch between the currencies in which its
  sales and services, purchases from overseas suppliers and borrowings in various foreign currencies. Market Risk is the risk that
  changes in market prices such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates will affect income or value of its holding financial
  assets/ instruments. The exchange rate between rupee and foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent years and
  may fluctuate significantly in the future.

     As a result operations of the Company are adversely affected as rupee appreciates/ depreciates against US Dollar.
                                                                                                                                                             (` in crore)

     Sensitivity Analysis								
	The sensitivity of profit or loss to changes in the exchange rates arises mainly from foreign currency denominated financial
  instruments as mentioned below.
                                                                                                                                                           (` in crore)

     If exchange rate is favourably affected with decrease by 2%, loss shall also accordingly be affected.

     Interest Rate Risk
	Interest rate risk can be either fair value interest rate risk or cash flow interest rate risk. Fair value interest rate risk is the risk
  of changes in fair values of fixed interest bearing investments because of fluctuations in the interest rates, in cases where the
  borrowings are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of
  floating interest bearing investments will fluctuate because of fluctuations in the interest rates.
     Exposure to Interest Rate Risk

	Interest rate risk of the Company arises from borrowings. The Company endeavor to adopt a policy of ensuring that maximum

                                                                                                                                                                      101

      of its interest rate risk exposure is at fixed rate. The Company’s interest-bearing financial instruments are reported as below:

      Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed-rate instruments

      The Company does not account for any fixed-rate financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss.
      Therefore, a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss.

      Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable-rate instruments							

      A reasonably possible change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would increase/ (decrease) equity and
      profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency exchange
      rates, remain constant.

                                                                                                                               (` in crore)
      Impact on profit/ (loss)/ equity                                                        For the year ended       For the year ended
                                                                                                March 31, 2017           March 31, 2016
      Impact of increase in interest rate by 100 basis point                                               (264)                     (269)
      If interest rate is positively affected with i.e. decrease by 100 basis point, loss shall also accordingly be affected.

	The risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves. This calculation also
  assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet date and is calculated based on risk exposures outstanding as at that date.
  The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the period.

      Derivative financial instruments

      The Company does not hold derivative financial instruments

	The Company offsets financial asset and financial liability when it currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the
  recognized amounts and the Company intends either to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle the liability
  simultaneously.

      Credit risk

	Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by the customer/ counter party resulting in a financial loss. The maximum
  exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is carrying value of respective financial assets.

	Trade receivables and unbilled revenue are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from the customers. Credit
  risk has always been managed by each business segment through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously
  monitoring the credit worthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. On
  account of adoption of Ind AS 109, the Company uses expected credit loss (ECL) model to assess the impairment loss or gain.
  ECL methodology depends on whether there is any significant increase in credit risk. In case of significant increase in credit risk,
  life time ECL is used; otherwise twelve month ECL is used. The Company uses a provision matrix to compute the expected
  credit loss allowance for trade receivables and unbilled revenues. The provision matrix takes into account available external and
  internal credit risk factors such as default risk of industry, credit default swap quotes, credit ratings from international credit
  rating agencies and historical experience for the customers.

Notes on Accounts to the Abridged Financial Statements

 redit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited as the Company generally invests in deposits with banks and financial institutions
C
with high credit ratings assigned by international and/or domestic credit rating agencies. Investments primarily include investment in
liquid mutual fund units, quoted bonds issued by Government and Quasi Government organizations and certificates of deposit which
are funds deposited at a bank for a specified time period.

Liquidity risk
The Company’s principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and the cash flow that is generated from operations.
Competative intensity has adversely impacted revenue and consequent cash accruals during the year. This, coupled with current
level of debt and imminent repayment obligations, has lead to stress on liquidity profile. The Company closely monitors its liquidity
position and is attempting to enhance its sources of funding by increasing cash flow generated from its operations and realisations
from other proposed measures.

Liquidity risk is the financial risk that is encountered due to uncertainty resulting in difficulty in meeting its obligations. An entity is
exposed to liquidity risk if markets on which it depends are subject to loss of liquidity for any reason; extraneous or intrinsic to its
business operations, affecting its credit rating or unexpected cash outflows. A position can be hedged against market risk but still
entail liquidity risk.

Prudence requires liquidity risk to be managed in addition to market, credit and other risks as it has tendency to compound other
risks. It entails management of asset, liabilities focused on a medium to long-term perspective and future net cash flows on a day-
by-day basis in order to assess liquidity risk.

Current and prospective liquidity risk is encountered when the Company is required to meet its obligations. The Company’s approach
to managing liquidity, that it will have sufficient cash and financial assets to meet its obligations and collateral needs, both expected
and unexpected, under normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses. Dynamic nature of the underlying
businesses necessitates that the treasury function ensures flexibility in funding by maintaining adequate working capital and availability
under committed credit lines, for uninterrupted business operations. Existing operations of the Company are primarily funded through
long term loans and advances. The Company is seeking to maintain/ enhance the level of working capital credit lines, so that
operations are performed at optimum level.

Periodic budgets and rolling forecasts are prepared at the level of operating subsidiaries as regular practice and in accordance with
limits specified by the Company. 49% of the total debt will be payable in less than one year i.e. during the financial year ended as
at March 31, 2018. Apart from this, there is an outstanding principal of ` 18,738 crore and interest as applicable thereon payable
to the lenders. The Company believes that working capital credit lines need significant enhancement pending infusion of funds from
the proposed strategic transactions/ sale of assets and rolling over of loans with existing lenders.

Employee Benefits

Gratuity: In accordance with the applicable Indian laws, the Company provides for the gratuity, a defined benefit retirement plan
(Gratuity Plan) for all employees. The Gratuity Plan provides a lump sum payment to vested employees, at retirement or termination
of employment, an amount based on respective employee’s last drawn salary and for the years of employment with the Company.

The gratuity plan is governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 (Gratuity Act). The Company is bound to pay the statutory
minimum gratuity as prescribed under Gratuity Act. There are no minimum funding requirements for a gratuity plan in India. The
Company’s philosophy is to fund the benefits based on its own liquidity and tax position as well as level of underfunding of the plan
vis-à-vis settlements. The management is responsible for the overall governance of the plan. The management has outsourced the
investment management of the fund to insurance company which in turn manages these funds as per the mandate provided to them
by the trustees and applicable insurance and other regulations.

The Company operates its gratuity and superannuation plans through separate trusts which is administered and managed by the Trustees.
As on March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, the contributions towards superannuation plans have been invested in Insurer Managed
Funds.

The plan is in the nature of a defined benefit plan which is sponsored by the Company and hence it underwrites all the risks pertaining
to the plan. In particular, there is a risk for the Company that any significant change in salary growth or demographic experience
or inadequate returns on underlying plan assets can result in an increase in cost of providing these benefits to employees in future.

The defined benefit plan exposes the Company to actuarial risks such as logentivity risks. interest risk and market (Investment) risk.

         Provident Fund: Under this scheme, the employee and employer each make monthly contribution to the plan equal to 12%
         of the covered employee’s basic salary. Contributions are made to the trust established by the Company. As at March 31,
         2017, based on the actuarial valuation, Fair value of plan assets is ` 224 crore (Previous year ` 253 crore), the present
         value of defined benefit obligation is ` 206 crore (Previous year ` 237 crore). For the year ended March 31,2017, the
         Company has contributed ` 5 crore (Previous year ` 4 crore) towards Provident Fund.
         The assumptions made for the above are discount rate of 7.52%, average remaining tenure of Investment Portfolio is 5
         years and guaranteed rate of return is 8.65%.

Note 2.18 (Note 2.50 of Annual Accounts)
Employee Stock Option Schemes
The Company operates two Employee Stock Option Plans; ESOS Plan 2008 and ESOS Plan 2009, which cover eligible employees
of the Company and its Subsidiaries. ESOS Plans are administered through an ESOS Trust. The Vesting of the Options is on the
expiry of one year from the date of Grant as per Plan under the respective ESOS(s). In respect of Options granted, the accounting
value of Options (based on market price of the share on the date of the grant of the Option) is accounted as deferred employee
compensation, which is amortised on a straight line basis over the Vesting Period. Each Option entitles the holder thereof to apply for
and be allotted/ transferred one Equity Share of the Company of ` 5 each upon payment of the Exercise Price during the Exercise
Period. The maximum Exercise Period is 10 years from the date of Grant of Options.

The Company has established a Trust for the implementation and management of ESOS Plans for the benefit of its present and future
employees. Advance of ` 387 crore (` 387 crore as on March 31,2016 and as on April 1, 2015) has been granted to the Trust and the said
amount has been utilised by the Trust for purchasing 2.13 crore (2.13 crore as on March 31,2016 and as on April 1, 2015) Equity Shares
during the period upto March 31, 2017. The fall in the value of these underlying shares on account of market volatility and the loss, if any,
can be determined only at the end of the exercise period under ESOS Scheme.

Amortization of compensation includes write back of ` 3,27,600 (` 13,09,300 as on March 31, 2016 and ` 2 crore as on April 1,
2015) based on intrinsic value of Options which has been vested under ESOS Plan 2008 and reflected in Statement of Profit and
Loss under Employees Benefits Expenses. No amount is chargeable in respect of Options granted under ESOS Plan 2009.

The weighted average remaining contractual life for the share options outstanding as at March 31, 2017 was 2.94 years (March
31, 2016: 2.60 years)


If the entity would have estimated fair value computed on the basis of Black Scholes pricing model, the compensation cost for
the year ended March 31, 2017 for ESOS Plan 2008 and ESOS Plan 2009 would have been ` 0.35 crore and ` 1.22 crore
respectively. The key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of options are given below.

The expected life of the share options is based on historical data and current expectations and is not necessarily indicative of
exercise patterns that may occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility over a period similar
to the life of the options is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.

The Company has unabsorbed business losses/depreciation and long term capital losses which according to the management will be
used to setoff taxable profit arising, in next few years from, operation and/or sale of asset of the Company.

Significant management judgement has been considered in determining the provision for income tax, deferred tax assets and
liabilities and recoverability of deferred tax assets. The recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on estimate of the taxable
income for the period over which deferred tax assets will be recovered.

Significant Accounting Policies to the Abridged Consolidated Financial Statements

Note 1

General Information and Significant Accounting Policies

1.1 General Information

      Reliance Communications Limited (“RCOM” or “the Company”), founded by late Shri Dhirubhai H Ambani, is the flagship
      company of the Reliance Group. The Company is registered under the Companies Act, 1956, having Registered Office at
      H Block, 1st Floor, Dhirubhai Ambani Knowledge City, Navi Mumbai 400710 and its securities are listed on the BSE Limited
      and the National Stock Exchange of India Limited.

      RCOM is India’s foremost and truly integrated telecommunications service provider in the private sector. RCOM has established
      pan India, next generation, integrated (wireless and wireline), convergent (long distance, voice, data video and internet) digital
      network that is capable of supporting the best of class services spanning the entire communications value chain. RCOM and its
      subsidiaries own and operate the next generation IP enabled connectivity infrastructure, comprising of fibre optic cable systems
      in India, build, own and operate telecommunication towers, submarine cable network infrastructure globally and related assets
      at designated sites and to provide passive telecommunication infrastructure assets on a shared basis to wireless service providers
      and other communications service providers under long term contracts. In addition, its operation also includes managed internet
      data centers and direct to home digital TV services.

1.2 Principles of Consolidation

      The Consolidated Financial Statements relate to the Company, all of its subsidiary companies and associates (hereinafter
      collectively referred to as “the Group”). The Company controls an entity when it is exposed to or has rights to variable returns
      from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Associates
      are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over the financial and operating
      policies. A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of
      the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities. Interest in associates and the joint venture are
      accounted for using the equity method. The financial statements of entities are included in the consolidated financial statements
      from the date on which control commences and until the date on which control ceases. The Consolidated Financial Statements
      have been prepared on the following bases.

      (a) The financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries are consolidated by combining like items of assets, liabilities,
          incomes and expenses and cash flows after fully eliminating intra group balances and intra group transactions resulting
          in unrealized profit or loss in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standard (“Ind AS”) 110 “Consolidated Financial
          Statements” as referred to in the Indian Accounting Standards Rules, 2015 and as amended from time to time.

      (b) Investments in subsidiaries are eliminated and differences between the costs of investment over the net assets on the
          date of investment or on the date of the financial statements immediately preceding the date of investment in subsidiaries
          are recognised as Goodwill or Capital Reserve, as the case may be. Investment in associates and joint ventures are
          initially recognised at cost, which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Consolidated Financial
          Statements include the Group’s share of profit or loss and other comprehensive income (OCI) of equity accounted investees,
          until the date on which significant influence or joint control ceases. When the Group’s share of loss in an equity accounted
          investment equals or exceeds its interest in the entity, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred
          obligations or made payments on behalf of the other entity.

      (c)   Changes in ownership interests for transactions with non controlling interests that do not result in loss of control are treated
            as the transactions with the equity owners of the Group. For purchases from non controlling interests, the difference
            between fair value of any consideration paid and the relevant share acquired of the carrying value of net assets of the
            subsidiary is recorded in equity. Gains or losses on disposals to non-controlling interests are also recorded in equity.

		          When the Group ceases to consolidate or equity account for an investment because of loss of control, joint control or
            significant influence, any retained interest in the entity is remeasured to its fair value with the change in carrying amount
            recognised in profit or loss. This fair value becomes initial carrying amount for the purpose of subsequent accounting for
            the retained interest as an associate, joint venture or financial asset.

      (d) Share of Non Controlling Interest in net profit or loss of consolidated subsidiaries for the year is identified and adjusted against
          income of the Group in order to arrive at the net income attributable to the Equity Shareholders of the Company.

      (e) Share of Non Controlling Interest in net assets of consolidated subsidiaries is identified and presented in the consolidated
          statement of profit or loss, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated balance sheet respectively as a
          separate item from liabilities and the Shareholders’ Equity.

      (f)   The Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared using uniform Accounting Policies for like transactions and other
            events in similar circumstances and are presented in the same manner as far as possible, as the standalone financial
            statements of the Company.

Significant Accounting Policies to the Abridged Consolidated Financial Statements

1.3		    Recent Accounting Developments
		       Standards issued but not yet effective:
		In March 2017, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (the MCA), Government of India (GoI) issued the Companies (Indian
   Accounting Standards) (Amendments) Rules, 2017, notifying amendments to Ind AS 7 ‘Statement of Cash Flows’ and Ind
   AS 102 ‘Share-based payment.’
		The amendments are applicable to the Company with effect from April 1, 2017.
		       Amendment to Ind AS 7: Statement of Cash Flows
		       The amendment to Ind AS 7 requires the entities to provide disclosures that enable the users of the financial statements
         to evaluate changes in liabilities arising from the financing activities, including both, changes arising from cash flows and
         non cash changes, suggesting inclusion of a reconciliation between opening and closing balances in the balance sheet for
         liabilities arising from the financing activities, to meet the disclosure requirement.
		       Amendment to Ind AS 102: Share based payments
		The amendment to Ind AS 102 provides specific guidance as to the measurement of cash settled awards, modification of
   cash settled awards and awards that include a net settlement feature in respect of withholding taxes. It clarifies that the
   fair value of cash settled awards is determined on the basis consistent with that used for equity settled awards. Market-
   based performance conditions and non vesting conditions are reflected in the ‘fair values’, but non market performance
   conditions and service vesting conditions are reflected in the estimate of the number of awards expected to vest. Also, the
   amendment clarifies that if the terms and conditions of the cash settled share based payment transactions are modified
   with the result that it becomes an equity settled share based payment transaction, the transaction is accounted for as such
   from the date of the modification.
		Further, the amendment requires the award that includes the net settlement feature in respect of withholding taxes to be
   treated as the equity settled in its entirety. The cash payment to the tax authority is treated as if it was part of an equity
   settlement.
1.4 Other Significant Accounting Policies
    (a) Basis of Preparation of Consolidated Financial Statements
		       The consolidated financial statements are prepared under historical cost convention/ fair valuation under the Scheme
         approved by the Hon’ble High Court, in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in India and
         in compliance with the Ind AS specified under Section 133 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“the Act”) read with Rule 3 of
         the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Amendment
         Rules, 2016 and other provisions of the Act, to the extent notified and applicable as well as applicable guidance notes and
         pronouncements of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (the ICAI).
		       These consolidated financial statements for the year ended March 31, 2017 are the first financial statements that the
         Group has prepared under Ind AS. For all periods upto and including the year ended March 31, 2016, the Group prepared
         its financial statements in accordance with the accounting standards notified under Section 133 of the Act, read together
         with Rule 7 of the Companies (Accounts) Rules, 2014 (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Previous GAAP’) used for its
         statutory reporting requirements in India immediately before adopting Ind AS.
		Pursuant to first proviso to sub-section (1) of section 136 of the Act read with Rule 10 of Companies (Accounts) Rules,
  2014, the Company has prepared abridged standalone Ind AS financial statements. In order to giving a fair presentation of
  financial statement, the format of the abridged financial statement in AOC-3 has been suitably modified in line with the
  requirements of Division II of Schedule III of Ind AS.
		       All assets and liabilities have been classified as current or non current as per the Group’s normal operating cycle and other
         criteria as set out under Ind AS and in the Schedule III to the Act. Based on the nature of the services and their realisation
         in cash and cash equivalents, the Group has ascertained its operating cycle as twelve months for the purpose of current or
         non-current classification of assets and liabilities.
    (b) Functional Currency and Presentation Currency
		       These consolidated financial statements are presented in Indian Rupees (“Rupees” or “`“) which is functional currency of
         the Company. All amounts are rounded off to the nearest crore, unless stated otherwise.
    (c) Use of Estimates
		       The preparation and presentation of consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions to be made that
         affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities on the date of the consolidated
         financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Difference between
         actual results and estimates are recognised in the period in which the results are known/ materialised. Estimates and
         underlying assets are reviewed on periodical basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised prospectively.

                                                                                                                                  129

Significant Accounting Policies to the Abridged Consolidated Financial Statements

		        The preparation of financial statements requires the use of accounting estimates which, by definition, will seldom equal the
          actual results. The Management also needs to exercise judgement in applying the accounting policies.
		        This note provides an overview of the areas that involved a higher degree of judgments or complexity, and of items which
          are more likely to be materially adjusted due to estimates and assumptions turning out to be different than those originally
          assessed. Detailed information about each of these estimates and judgements is included in relevant notes together with
          information about the basis of calculation for each affected line item in the financial statements.
		Critical estimates and judgements
		The Group has based assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements were prepared.
   Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes or
   circumstances arising that are beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they
   occur.
		        The areas involving critical estimates or judgements pertain to current tax expense and tax payable, fair value of unlisted
          securities, goodwill impairment, estimated useful life of property, plant and equipment including intangible assets,
          measurement of defined benefit obligation, provision for asset retirement obligation, recognition of deferred tax assets
          for carried forward tax losses, impairment of trade receivables and other financial assets. Estimates and judgements are
          continually evaluated. They are based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events
          that may have a financial impact on the group and that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
		        (i)	Useful life of Property, Plant and Equipment including intangible assets: Residual values, useful lives and methods of
               depreciation of property, plant and equipment are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted prospectively, if
               appropriate.
		        (ii)   Taxes : The Group provides for tax considering the applicable tax regulations and based on probable estimates.
			Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns giving due considerations to tax laws and
    establishes provisions in the event if required as a result of differing interpretation or due to retrospective amendments,
    if any.
			The recognition of deferred tax assets is based on availability of sufficient taxable profits in the Group against which
    such assets can be utilized.
		        (iii)	Fair value measurement and valuation process: The Group measured financial assets and liabilities if any, at fair value
                 for financial reporting purposes.
		        (iv)	Trade receivables and other financial assets: The Group follows a ‘simplified approach’ (i.e. based on lifetime Expected
                Credit Loss (ECL)) for recognition of impairment of loss allowance on Trade receivables (including lease receivables).
                For the purpose of measuring lifetime ECL allowance for trade receivables, the Group estimates irrecoverable amount
                based on the ageing of the receivable balances and historical experience. Further, a large number of minor receivables
                are grouped into homogeneous groups and assessed for impairment collectively. Individual trade receivables are
                written off when management deems them not to be collectable.
		        (v)	Defined benefit plans (gratuity benefits) : The Group’s obligation on account of gratuity and compensated absences is
               determined based on actuarial valuations. An actuarial valuation involves making various assumptions that may differ
               from actual development in the future. These include determination of the discount rate, future salary increase and
               mortality rates. Due to the complexities involved in the valuation and its long-term nature, these liabilities are highly
               sensitive to changes in assumptions. All assumptions are reviewed at each reporting date.
			The parameter subject to frequent changes is the discount rate. In determining appropriate discount rate, the
    management considers interest rates of government bonds in currencies, consistent with the currencies of the post-
    employment benefit obligation.
			The mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality tables in India. Those mortality tables tend to change only
    at interval in response to demographic changes. Future salary increase and gratuity increase are based on expected
    future inflation rates.
		        (vi)	Non-financial assets are reviewed for impairment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
                carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the
                asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss, if any.
		        (vii) Provisions and Contingent liabilities are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect best estimate.
      (d) Property, Plant and Equipment
		        (i)    Property, Plant and Equipment (PPE) are stated at cost net of Modvat/ Cenvat less accumulated depreciation,
                 amortisation and impairment loss, if any. Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only if it is probable that the future
                 economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group.

             is valued using replacement cost approach, certain buildings are valued using income approach and other buildings
             and improvements are fair valued using reproduction cost method. Real Estate Assets comprising of Land owned by
             Campion Properties Limited, a subsidiary of the Company, have been fair valued using the market approach while
             buildings are valued using cost approach. DAKC Land and Buildings have been valued using the income capitalization
             approach. CDMA Electronics have been fair valued using replacement cost approach.

		      (vii) Expenditure of capital nature incurred on assets taken on operating lease is depreciated over the remaining period of
              the lease term.
		      (viii) Leasehold Land with lease term of more than 50 years is classified as finance lease and depreciated over the period

      (e) Intangible Assets other than Goodwill
		              Intangible assets acquired are measured on initial recognition at cost. Cost includes all direct costs relating to
            (i)	
                acquisition of Intangible assets and borrowing cost relating to qualifying assets.
		          (ii)   Telecom Licenses are stated at cost as applicable less accumulated amortisation and impairment, if any.
		          (iii) Indefeasible Right of Connectivity (IRC) are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation.

                 expenditure will flow to the Group.
		          (v)    Intangible assets, namely entry fees/ fees for Telecom Licenses and Brand Licenses are amortised on the basis
                   of Straight Line Method, over the balance period of Licenses. IRC and Software are amortized from the date of
                   acquisition or commencement of commercial services, whichever is later.
		          (vi) There is no intangible asset assessed with indefinite useful life.
		          (vii) The life of amortisation of the intangible assets are as follows.
			                (1) Telecom Licenses - 12.50 to 20 years

      (f)   Lease

		i)               Operating lease:

			As a Lessee:

			Where the lessor effectively retains substantially all risks and benefits of ownership of the leased assets, they are
    classified as operating lease. Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in the Statement of Profit
    and Loss on a straight line basis over the period of lease unless the payments are structured to increase in line with
    expected general inflation to compensate for the lessor’s expected inflationary cost increase.

			As a Lessor:

			Rental income from operating lease is recognised on a straight line basis over the lease term unless payments to
    the Company are structured to increase in line with expected general inflation to compensate for the Company’s
    expected inflationary cost increase; such increases are recognised in the year in which such benefits accrue. Assets
    given on operating lease are included in PPE/ Intangible Assets. Costs, including depreciation/ amortisation, are
    recognised as an expense in the Statement of Profit and Loss.

		ii)              Finance lease:

			As a Lessee:
			Assets held under finance leases are initially recognised as assets at the commencement of the lease at their fair value
    or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between finance
    charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of
    the liability. Finance charges are recognised in the statement of profit and loss, unless they are directly attributable
    to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Company’s general policy on borrowing
    costs. Such assets are depreciated/ amortised over the period of lease or estimated useful life of the assets whichever
    is less.

Significant Accounting Policies to the Abridged Consolidated Financial Statements

			As a Lessor:
			Amounts due from lessees under finance leases are recognised as receivables at the amount of the Company’s net
    investment in the leases. Finance lease income is allocated to accounting period so as to reflect a constant periodic
    rate of return on the net investment outstanding in respect of the lease.
    (g) Impairment of Non Financial Assets
		        Goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful life are tested annually for impairment or more frequently, if
          events or changes in circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. Other assets are tested for impairment whenever
          events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An asset is treated as
          impaired when carrying cost of assets exceeds its recoverable value. An impairment loss is charged to the Statement of
          Profit and Loss in the year in which an asset is identified as impaired. Impairment loss recognised in prior accounting period
          is increased/ reversed (for the assets other than Goodwill) where there is change in the estimate of recoverable value.
          Recoverable value is higher of net selling price and value in use.
    (h) Inventories of Stores, Spares and Communication Devices
		        Inventories of stores, spares and communication devices are accounted for at cost and all other costs incurred in bringing
          the inventory to their present location and condition, determined on weighted average basis or net realisable value,
          whichever is less. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less estimated costs
          necessary to make the sale.
    (i)   Employee Benefits
		        Short-term employee benefits
		        All employee benefits payable wholly within twelve months of rendering the service are classified as short-term employee
          benefits. These benefits include compensated absence such as paid annual leave and sickness leave. The undiscounted
          amount of short-term employee benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the services rendered by the employees is
          recognized as an expense during the period.
		        Long term employee benefits
		        (i)   Defined contribution plan
			             The Group’s contribution towards employees’ Superannuation Plan is recognized as an expense during the period in
                which it accrues.
		        (ii) Defined benefit plans
			Provident Fund
			Provident Fund contributions are made to a Trust administered by the Trustees or other recognised fund. Interest payable
    to the Provident Fund members, shall not be at a rate lower than the statutory rate. Liability is recognized for any
    shortfall in the Income of the fund vis-à-vis liability of the interest as per statutory rates to the members. The Company’s
    contribution towards employees’ Provident fund is recognized as an expense during the period in which it accrues.
			Gratuity Plan
			The Company’s gratuity benefit scheme is a defined benefit plan. The Company’s net obligation in respect of the
    gratuity benefit scheme is calculated by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in
    return for their service in the current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to determine its present value,
    mortality rate and the fair value of plan assets is deducted. Mortality rate is based on publicly available mortality table
    in India.
			Present value of the obligation under such defined benefit plan is determined based on actuarial valuation using the
    Projected Unit Credit Method.
			Obligation is measured at present value of the estimated future cash flows. Discount rates used for determining
    present value of obligation under the defined benefit plan, are based on market yield of Government Securities as at
    the balance sheet date that have terms approximating to the terms of the related obligation.
			Remeasurements which comprise of actuarial gain and losses, the return of plan assets (excluding interest) and the
    effect of assets ceiling (if any, excluding interest) are recognised in Other Comprehensive Income.
			             Plan Assets of Defined Benefit Plans have been measured at fair value.
		        (iii) Other Long term employment benefits
			             Compensated absences which are not expected to occur within twelve months after the end of the period in which
                the employee renders the related services are recognized as a liability at the present value of the defined benefit

                                                                                                                                   133

                   obligation at the balance sheet date, determined based on actuarial valuation using Projected Unit Credit Method.
                   Discount rates used for determining present value of the obligation under the defined benefit plan, are based on the
                   market yield on Government Securities as at the balance sheet date. Remeasurements gains or losses are recognised
                   in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise.
      (j)   Borrowing Cost
		          Borrowing costs attributable to the acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised as part of the cost of
            such assets upto the commencement of commercial operations. A qualifying asset is one that necessarily takes substantial
            period of time to get ready for intended use. Other borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the year in which they
            are incurred.
      (k) Foreign Currency Transactions
            (i)    Transactions denominated in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rates prevailing at the time of the
                   transaction.
		          (ii)   Monetary items denominated in foreign currencies at the year end are restated at the year end rates.
		          (iii) Non monetary foreign currency items are carried at cost (i.e. translated using the exchange rates at the time of initial
                  transactions).
		          (iv) Exchange difference on monetary items is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which it
                 arises except for;
			                (a) Exchange difference on foreign currency borrowings relating to depreciable capital asset is included in cost of
                       assets.
			                (b) Exchange difference on foreign currency transactions, on which receipt and/ or payments is not planned, initially
                       recognised in Other Comprehensive Income and reclassified from Equity to profit and loss on repayment of the
                       monetary items.
		          (v)    All long term foreign currency monetary items consisting of loans taken before March 31, 2016 and which relate
                   to the acquisition of depreciable capital assets at the end of the period/ year are restated at the rate prevailing at
                   the balance sheet date. Exchange difference including attributable to the interest arising as a result is added to or
                   deducted from cost of the assets as per notification dated December 29, 2011 and August 9, 2012 issued by the
                   Ministry of Company Affairs (MCA), Government of India and depreciated over the balance life of the capital asset.
                   Exchange difference on other long term foreign currency loans is accumulated in “Foreign Currency Monetary Item
                   Translation Difference Account (FCMITDA)” which will be amortized over the balance period of monetary assets or
                   liabilities.
		          (vi) The results and financial position of foreign operations with functional currency different from the presentation
                 currency, are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
			                (a)	assets and liabilities for each consolidated statement of financial position presented are translated at the closing
                        rate at the date of that consolidated statement of financial position;
			                (b)	income and expenses for each consolidated statement of comprehensive income are translated at average
                        exchange rates (unless average rate is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates
                        prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the rate on the dates
                        of the transactions); and
			                (c)	all resulting exchange differences are recognised in other comprehensive income.
		          (vii) Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities
                  of the foreign entity and translated into rupee, the functional currency of the company, at the exchange rates at the
                  reporting date. Exchange difference arising are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity,
                  except to the extent that the exchange differences is allocated to the non controlling interests.
      (l)   Revenue Recognition
		          (i)    Revenue is recognised to the extent it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and revenue can
                   be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is being made. Revenue is measured at the fair value of the
                   consideration received or receivable.
		          (ii)   Revenue is recognised as and when services are provided on the basis of actual usage of the Company’s network.
                   Revenue on upfront charges for services with lifetime validity and fixed validity periods are recognised over the
                   estimated useful life of the subscribers and specified fixed validity period, as appropriate. The estimated useful life is
                   consistent with estimated churn of the subscribers.
		          (iii) The Company sells Right of Use (ROUs) that provide to the customers with network capacity/ passive infrastructure,
                  typically over a period of 5 to 20 years without transferring legal title or giving an option to purchase the network
                  capacity/ passive infrastructure. Capacity services revenues are accounted as operating lease and recognised in the

Significant Accounting Policies to the Abridged Consolidated Financial Statements

              Company’s income statement over the life of the contract. Bills raised on the customers/ payments received from the
              customers for long term contracts and for which revenue is not recognised are included in deferred revenue. Revenue
              on non cancellable ROUs are also recognised as licencing income over the period of contract. Revenue on non
              cancellable contracts for right to use of specified fibre pairs/ ducts for a period of 15 to 20 years or economic useful
              life is recognized as revenue on delivery of such assets to the customers. In revenue arrangements including more
              than one deliverable, the arrangements are divided into separate units of accounting. Deliverables are considered
              separate units of accounting if the following two conditions are met: (1) the deliverable has value to the customer
              on a standalone basis and (2) there is evidence of the fair value of the item. The arrangement considered is allocated
              to each separate unit of accounting based on its relative fair value.
		      (iv) Standby maintenance charges are invoiced separately from capacity sales. Revenue relating to standby maintenance
             is recognised over the period in which service is provided. Any amount billed prior to providing of service is included
             in deferred revenue. Revenue from other service is recognized as and when service is rendered.
		      (v)   Network services include capacity lease services, IP transit, IPLC (private lines leased to customers), backup service for
              other network operators and all other services. The customer typically pays charges for network services periodically
              over the life of the contract, which may be up to three years. Network revenue is recognised in the Company’s
              Statement of Profit and Loss over the term of the contract.
		      (vi) Sale of handsets and accessories are recognised when goods are supplied and are recorded net of trade discounts,
             rebates, commissions to distributors and dealers and sales taxes. It does not include inter company transfers.
		      (vii) Interest income on investment is recognised on time proportion basis. Interest income is accounted using the
              applicable Effective Interest Rate (EIR), which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts
              over the expected life of the financial assets to that asset’s net carrying amount on initial recognition. Dividend is
              considered when right to receive is established. The Group recognises income from units in the Fixed Income Schemes
              of Mutual Funds, where income accrued is held till declaration or payment thereof for the benefit of the unit holders.
		      (viii) Revenue is recognised net of taxes when the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) Tower is Ready For Installation of
               customer equipments and as per the terms of the agreements.
		      (ix) Activation fees, subscription revenue and monthly subscription in respect of DTH are recognised on accrual basis, net
             of service tax, entertainment tax and trade discount.
   (m) Taxes on Income and Deferred Tax
		      Income Tax comprises of current and deferred tax. It is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss except to the extent
        that it relates to a business combination or to an item recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
		      Provision for income tax is made on the basis of taxable income for the year at the current rates. Tax expense comprises
        of current tax and deferred tax at the applicable enacted or substantively enacted rates. Current tax represents amount of
        Income Tax payable/ recoverable in respect of taxable income/ loss for the reporting period. Deferred tax represents the
        effect of temporary difference between carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements
        and the corresponding tax base used in the computation of taxable income. Deferred tax liabilities are generally accounted
        for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax asset is recognised for all deductible temporary differences, carried
        forward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available
        against which such deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset
        when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities and when
        deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to the income tax levied by the same taxation authority on either the same
        taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net or simultaneous basis.
        Deferred tax assets/ liabilities are not recognised for initial recognition of Goodwill or on an asset or liability in a transaction
        that is not a business combination and at the time of transaction affects neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or
        loss. MAT credit is recognised as an asset, only if it is probable that the Company will pay normal income tax during the
        specified period.
   (n) Government Grants
		      Subsidies granted by the Government for providing telecom services in rural areas are recognised as other operating income
        in accordance with relevant terms and conditions of the applicable scheme and agreement.
   (o) Provisions including Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) and Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets
		      Provisions involving substantial degree of estimation in measurement are recognised when there is a present obligation as a
        result of past events and it is probable that there will be an outflow of resources. Provisions are determined by discounting
        expected future cashflows at the pre tax rate that reflects current market assumptions of time value of money and risk
        specific to the liability. A disclosure for a contingent liability is made when there is a possible obligation or a present
        obligation that may, but probably will not, require an outflow of resources. When there is a possible obligation or a present
        obligation in respect of which the likelihood of outflow of resources is remote, no provision or disclosure is made.

                                                                                                                                       135

Significant Accounting Policies to the Abridged Consolidated Financial Statements

		          Asset Retirement Obligation (ARO) relates to the removal of telecom towers, sub marine cable systems and equipments
            when they will be retired from its active use. Provision is recognised based on the best estimate, of the management,
            of the eventual costs (net of recovery), using discounted cash flow, that relates to such obligation and is adjusted to
            the cost of such assets. Estimated future costs of decommissioning are reviewed annually and adjusted as appropriate.
            Changes in the estimated future costs or in the discount rate applied are added to or deducted from the cost of the asset.
            Contingent Assets are neither recognised nor disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.
      (p) Earnings per Share
		          In determining Earning per Share, the Group considers net profit after tax attributable to parent and includes post tax effect
            of any exceptional item. Number of shares used in computing basic earnings per share is the weighted average number of
            the shares, excluding the shares owned by the Trust, outstanding during the period. Dilutive earning per share is computed
            and disclosed after adjusting effect of all dilutive potential equity shares, if any except when results will be anti dilutive.
            Dilutive potential equity shares are deemed converted as at the beginning of the period, unless issued at a later date.
      (q) Employee Stock Option Scheme
		          In respect of stock options granted pursuant to the Company’s Employee Stock Options Scheme, fair value of the options
            is treated as discount and accounted as employee compensation cost over the vesting period. Employee compensation
            cost recognised earlier on grant of options is reversed in the period when the options are surrendered by any employee or
            lapsed as per the terms of the scheme.
      (r)   Treasury Equity
		          The Group has created an Employee Stock Option Scheme Trust (ESOS Trust) for providing share-based payment to
            its employees. The Group uses ESOS Trust as a vehicle for distributing shares to the employees under the employee
            remuneration schemes. The ESOS Trust buys shares of the Company from the market, for giving shares to the employees.
            The Group treats ESOS Trust as its extension and the shares held by ESOS Trust are treated as treasury equity.
		          Own equity instruments that are reacquired (treasury equity) are recognised at cost and deducted from equity. No gain
            or loss is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss, on purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own equity
            instruments. Any difference between carrying amount and consideration, if reissued, is recognised in equity.
      (s)   Measurement of Fair value of financial instruments
		          The Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require measurement of fair values for the financial instruments. The Group
            has an established control framework with respect to measurement of fair values. The management regularly reviews
            significant unobservable inputs and valuation adjustments. If third party information, such as broker quotes or pricing
            services, is used to measure fair values, then the management assesses evidence obtained from third parties to support the
            conclusion that such valuations meet requirements of Ind AS, including level in fair value hierarchy in which such valuations
            should be classified. When measuring fair value of a financial asset or a financial liability, the Group uses observable market
            data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in
            the valuation techniques as follows.
		          Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
		          Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e.
            as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
		          Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). If inputs used
            to measure fair value of an asset or a liability fall into different levels of fair value hierarchy, then fair value measurement
            is categorised in its entirety in the same level of fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the
            entire measurement. The Group recognises transfers between levels of fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting
            period during which the change has occurred. (Refer to note 2.15.1) for disclosures pertaining to the measurement of fair
            values).
      (t)   Financial Instruments
		          A financial instrument is any contract that gives rise to the financial asset of one entity and the financial liability or equity
            instrument of another entity. Financial instruments also include derivative contracts such as foreign currency foreign
            exchange forward contracts.
		Financial Assets
		          (i)   Initial recognition and measurement
			               All financial assets are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial assets not recorded at fair value
                  through Statement of Profit and Loss, transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisition of the financial asset.

		(ii) Subsequent measurement
			          Subsequent measurement of the debt instruments depends on the Group’s business model for managing asset and
             cash flow characteristics of the asset. There are three measurement categories into which the Group classifies its debt
             instruments.
			          Financial Assets measured at amortised cost
			          A ‘debt instrument’ is measured at the amortised cost, if both the following conditions are met:
			          a)   Asset is held within a business model, whose objective is to hold assets for collecting contractual cash flows, and
			          b)	Contractual terms of the asset give rise to cash flows, on specified dates, that are solely payments of principal
                  and interest (SPPI) on the principal amount outstanding. After initial measurement, such financial assets are
                  subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate (EIR) method. Amortised cost is
                  calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that are an integral
                  part of EIR. EIR amortisation is included in finance income in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Losses arising
                  from impairment are recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss. This category generally applies to trade and
                  other receivables.
			          Financial Assets measured at Fair Value through Other Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI)
			          A ‘debt instrument’ is classified as FVTOCI if both of the following criteria are met:
			          a)	Objective of the business model is achieved both, by collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets,
                 and
			          b)	Contractual cash flows of the asset represent SPPI: Debt instruments included within FVTOCI category are
                 measured initially as well as at each reporting date at fair value. Fair value movements are recognized in OCI.
                 However, the Group recognizes interest income, impairment loss and reversal and foreign exchange gain or loss
                 in the Statement of Profit and Loss. On derecognition of the asset, cumulative gain or loss previously recognised
                 in OCI is reclassified from the equity to Statement of Profit and Loss. Interest earned whilst holding FVTOCI debt
                 instrument is reported as interest income using EIR method.
			          Financial Assets measured at Fair Value through Profit or Loss (FVTPL)
			          Any debt instrument, which does not meet the criteria for categorization as at amortized cost or as FVTOCI, is classified
             as FVTPL. In addition, the Group may elect to designate a debt instrument, which otherwise meets amortized cost or
             FVTOCI criteria, as FVTPL. However, such election is allowed only if, doing so reduces or eliminates measurement or
             recognition inconsistency (referred to as ‘accounting mismatch’).
			Equity investments
			          All equity investments in scope of Ind AS 109 “Financial Instruments” are measured at fair value. Equity instruments
             which are held for trading are classified as FVTPL. For all other equity instruments, the Group decides to classify the same
             either as FVOCI or FVTPL. The Group makes such election on instrument by instrument basis. The classification is made
             on initial recognition, which is irrevocable. If the Group decides to classify an equity instrument as FVOCI, then all fair
             value changes on the instrument, excluding dividend, are recognized in the OCI. There is no recycling of the amounts
             from OCI to profit and loss, even on sale of investment. However, the Group may transfer the cumulative gain or loss
             within equity. Equity instruments included within FVTPL category are measured at fair value with all changes recognized
             in the Statement of Profit and Loss. Also, the Group has elected to apply the exemption available under Ind AS 101 to
             continue the carrying value for its investments in subsidiaries and associates as recognised in the financial statements as
             at the date of transition to Ind AS, measured as per the previous GAAP as at the date of transition.
			          Derecognition of Financial Assets
			          A financial asset is primarily derecognised when: (I) Rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired, or
             (II) The Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to pay
             the received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under ‘pass-through’ arrangement and either
             (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group has neither
             transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred control of the asset.
			          Impairment of Financial Assets
			          The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses associated with its assets carried at amortised
             cost. Impairment methodology applied depends on whether there has been a significant increase in the credit risk.
             As a practical expedient, the Group uses a provision matrix to determine impairment loss allowance on portfolio of its
             trade receivables, as permitted by Ind AS 109. Provision matrix is based on its historically observed default rates over
             the expected life of the trade receivables and is adjusted for forward looking estimates. At every reporting date, the
             historical observed default rates are updated and changes in the forward looking estimates are analysed.

                                                                                                                                    137

			Financial Liabilities
			            (i)   Initial recognition and measurement
				All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, in the case of loans, borrowings and payables, net of
     directly attributable transaction costs. Financial liabilities include trade and other payables, loans and borrowings
     including bank overdrafts and derivative financial instruments.
			(ii) Subsequent measurement
				                 The measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as described herein:
				Financial liabilities at Fair Value through Profit or Loss: Financial liabilities at Fair Value through Profit or
     Loss include financial liabilities held for trading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at
     fair value through profit or loss. Financial liabilities are classified as held for trading, if they are incurred for the
     purpose of repurchasing in the near term. This category also includes derivative financial instruments entered into
     by the Group that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationship as defined by Ind AS 109.
     Gains or losses on liabilities held for trading are recognised in Statement of Profit or Loss.
				Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost: After initial recognition, interest bearing loans and borrowings
     are subsequently measured at amortised cost using Effective Interest Rate (EIR) method. Gains or losses
     are recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss when the liabilities are derecognised as well as through EIR
     amortisation process. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition
     and fees or costs that are an integral part of EIR. EIR amortisation is included as finance costs in the Statement
     of Profit and Loss.
     Derecognition of Financial Liabilities: A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability
				
     is discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same
     lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an
     exchange or modification is treated as the derecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new
     liability. The difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the Statement of Profit and Loss.
      (u) Business Combinations and Goodwill
		        Business Combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. Cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of
          the consideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fair value and the amount of any non controlling interests in the
          acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non controlling interests in the acquiree at
          fair value or at proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition related costs are expensed as incurred.
          At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recognised at their acquisition date fair
          values. If the business combination is achieved in stages, any previously held equity interest is remeasured at its acquisition
          date fair value, resulting gain or loss is recognised in Statement of Profit and Loss or OCI, as appropriate.
		        Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred and the amount
          recognised for non controlling interests, and any previous interest held, over the net identifiable assets acquired and
          liabilities assumed. If the fair value of net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregate consideration the difference is
          recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity as capital reserve provided there is clear evidence of
          the underlying reasons for classifying the business combination as a bargain purchase. In other cases, the bargain purchase
          gain is recognised directly in equity as capital reserve.
		        Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amount payable in the future is discounted to its
          present value as at the date of exchange. Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability.
          Amount classified as a financial liability is subsequently remeasured to fair value with change in fair value recognised in
          Statement in Profit and Loss.
		        Business Combinations that occurred before April 1, 2008, are not restated retrospectively in accordance with Ind AS 103
          “Business Combinations”. Carrying amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as part of past business combinations
          as well as the amounts of goodwill that arose from such transactions as they were determined under the previous GAAP
          are considered as their deemed cost under Ind AS as at the date of transition.
		        In respect of business combinations that occurred prior to April 1, 2008, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed
          cost, which represents the amount recorded under previous GAAP.

Goodwill
Goodwill is recognised on consolidation of financial statements of the subsidiaries as per details given herein:

There is no movement in the goodwill on consolidation except due to changes in foreign exchange currency fluctuation. Business
valuation is higher than book value of the assets and/ or recoverable value represented above, and hence impairment has not been
considered.
Recoverable amount of the operations is based on the fair value less costs of disposal, estimated using discounted cash flows. Fair
value measurement is categorised as a Level 3 fair value based on inputs in the valuation technique used.
Key assumptions used in the estimation of the recoverable amount are set out below.
The values assigned to the key assumptions represent the Management’s assessment of the future trends in the relevant industries
and have been based on the historical data from both: external and internal sources.

Discount rate has been a pre tax measure estimated based on the historical industry average and weighted-average cost of capital,
with the possible debt leveraging of 80% at interest rate of 9% per market.
No terminal value is included as this cash flows are more than sufficient to establish that impairment does not exist.
Budgeted EBITDA has been estimated taking into account past experience and adjusted as under.
Revenue growth has been projected taking into account the average growth levels experienced over the past three years and
estimated sales volume and prudent price growth for the next five years. It has been assumed that the sales price would increase in
line with the forecast inflation over the next five years.
Sensitivity Analysis: There is no significant risk that book value of goodwill could exceed its value in use considering reasonably
possible change in Discount Rate and EBIDTA growth rate.

The Group offsets tax assets and liabilities if and only if it has a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets and current tax
liabilities and deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities relating to income taxes levied by the same tax authorities.

Deferred Tax Assets are not provided on undistributed earnings of ` 3,705 crore as at March 31, 2017, of the subsidiaries, where it
is expected that earnings of the subsidiaries will not be distributed in foreseeable future. Generally, the Company indefinitely reinvests
all the accumulated undistributed earnings of the subsidiaries and accordingly, has not recorded any deferred taxes in relation to such
undistributed earnings of such entities. It is impracticable to determine the taxes payable when these earnings are remitted.

Significant management judgement has been considered in determining the provision for income tax, deferred tax assets and
liabilities and recoverability of deferred tax assets. Recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on estimates of taxable income by
each jurisdiction in which the relevant entity operates and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recovered.

Deferred Tax Assets have not been recognised in respect of losses of certain subsidiaries due to non existence of reasonable certainty,
and which may not be used to offset taxable profits elsewhere in the Group as there are no other tax planning opportunities or other
evidence of recoverability in the near future. Year wise expiry of such losses of `10,509 crore as at March 31, 2017 is as under.

       The Group has applied the following exemptions, available under Ind AS 101, for retrospective application, at the time of first
       time adoption of Ind AS.
       Business Combinations: Business Combinations that occurred before April 1, 2008, were not restated retrospectively in
       accordance with Ind AS 103 “Business Combinations”. Carrying amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as a part of
       the past business combinations as well as the amounts of goodwill that arose from such transactions as they were determined
       under the previous GAAP are considered as their deemed cost under Ind AS as at the date of the transition.
       Investments in Subsidiaries and Associates: The Group has elected to apply carrying amount of its investment in subsidiaries
       and associates as per the previous GAAP as the deemed cost on the date of the transition to Ind AS.
       Share based payments: As permitted under Ind AS 101 “First-time Adoption of Indian Accounting Standards”, Ind AS 102
       “Share Based Payment” has not been retrospectively applied to all share-based payment awards. This exemption has been
       applied for all equity awards, which have been vested before April 1, 2015. All such equity awards exempted from Ind AS
       102 continue to be accounted for under the intrinsic value approach as under the previous GAAP.
       Long Term Foreign Currency Monetary Items: The Group has opted to apply Ind AS 101 exemption and continued with the
       accounting policy adopted under the previous GAAP for accounting of exchange differences arising from translation of long
       term foreign currency monetary items recognised in the financial statements upto March 31, 2016.
       Deemed cost: In respect of Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets, certain assets have been fair valued and
       other assets have been retrospectively restated under Ind AS.
       Exchange Fluctuation Variation: As permitted under Ind AS 101, the Group has elected, to reset cumulative translation
       differences (gains and losses) for all foreign operations, and deemed to zero by transferring it to opening retained earnings
       at its transition date.

                                                                                                                                             143

      assets and liabilities under Ind AS 109 “Financial Instruments” prospectively for the transactions occurring on or after the date
      of the transition to Ind AS.
      Estimates: Upon an assessment of the estimates made under the previous GAAP, the Company has concluded that there was no
      necessity to revise such estimates under Ind AS except as a part of the transition where following estimates were required by Ind AS
      and not required by the previous GAAP.
      Classification and measurement of financial assets: The Group has classified the financial assets in accordance with Ind AS
      109 “Financial Instruments” on the basis of the facts and circumstances that exist on the date of the transition to Ind AS.
      Notes to reconciliation

        for business purpose
(v)     Consequent to the investigations by an investigative agency (CBI) in relation to the entire telecom sector in India, certain
        preliminary charges have been framed by a Trial Court in October, 2011 against Reliance Telecom Limited (RTL), a wholly
        owned subsidiary of the Company and three of the executives of the group. The charges so framed are preliminary in nature
        based on investigations only, and the persons named are presumed to be innocent, unless their alleged guilt is established
        after a fair trial. As legally advised, the persons so named deny all charges. Presently the trial is in progress. These preliminary
        charges have no impact on the business, operations, and/ or licenses of RTL and the Company and, even more so, are not
        connected in any manner to any other group companies.
(vi)    Spectrum Charges
        DoT had, during the earlier years, issued demand on the Company for ` 1,758 crore towards levy of one time Spectrum
        Charges, being the prospective charges for holding CDMA spectrum beyond 2.5 MHz for the period from January 1, 2013
        till the expiry of the initial terms of the respective Licenses. Based on a petition filed by the Company and its subsidiary,
        the Hon’ble High Court of Kolkata, vide its orders dated February 14 and April 19, 2013 has stayed the operation of the
        impugned demand till further order. The Company is of the view that the said demands, inter alia, are an alteration of financial
        terms of the licenses issued in the past and has also been legally advised, accordingly, no provision in this regard is required.

(vii)   License Fees and Special Audit
        Pursuant to the Telecom License Agreement, DoT directed audit of various Telecom companies including of the
        Company. The Special Auditors appointed by DoT were required to verify records of the Company and some of its
        subsidiaries for the years ended March 31, 2007 and March 31, 2008 relating to license fees and revenue share. The
        Company has received show cause notice dated January 31, 2012 and subsequently, received demand note dated
        November 8, 2012 based on report of the Special Audit directed by DoT relating to alleged shortfall of license fees of
        ` 314 crore and interest thereon as applicable. The Company challenged the said notices, inter alia demanding license fee on
        non telecom revenue based on Special Audit Report before the Hon’ble Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal
        (TDSAT) and also before the Hon’ble High Court of Kerala. The impugned demand has been stayed by Hon’ble High Court of
        Kerala during the pendency of the Petition. Meanwhile, Hon’ble TDSAT vide its judgment dated April 23, 2015 has set aside
        all License fee related demands and directed DoT to rework the license fees payable by the operators for the past periods, in
        light of the findings, observations and directions as per in the said judgment and to issue fresh demands, which the operators
        will pay within the time prescribed under the law. DoT has challenged TDSAT judgement in Hon’ble Supreme Court. The
        matter is pending before Hon’ble Supreme Court, though Hon’ble Supreme Court vide its order dated February 29, 2016
        allowed DoT to raise demand as per its understanding but not to enforce the same till the appeals are finally decided by
        the Supreme Court. As per the judgement of Hon’ble TDSAT dated April 23, 2015 which is operative as on date and other
        judicial pronouncements directly applicable to the issues of License fee dues raised by Special Auditors, there shall not be any
        liability of License fee and hence, no provision is required in the accounts of the Company.

Note 2.15 (Note 2.43 of Annual Accounts)

2.15.1 Financial Instruments
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current
transaction between the willing parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale.
The following methods and assumptions have been used to estimate the fair values:
Fair value of cash and short-term deposits, trade and other short term receivables, trade payables, other current liabilities, short
term loans from banks and other financial institutions approximate their carrying amounts largely due to the short term maturities
of these instruments
Financial Instruments with fixed and variable interest rates are evaluated by the Group based on parameters such as interest rates
and individual credit worthiness of the counterparty. Based on this evaluation, allowances are taken to account for the expected
losses of these receivables.
Fair value hierarchy
Level 1 - Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as
prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
Level 3 - Inputs for the assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The carrying value and fair value of the financial instruments by categories were as follows:
                                                                                                                                       (` in crore)

create transparency, minimize adverse impact on the business objectives and enhance competitive advantage. It defines the risk management
approach across the enterprise at various levels including documentation and reporting and contains different risk models, which help in
identifying risks trend, exposure and potential impact analysis at the Company level as also separately for the business segments.
T
 he Company has instituted a self governed framework based on identification of potential risk areas, evaluation of risk intensity, and clear-
cut risk mitigation policies, plans and procedures, both at the enterprise and operating levels. The framework seeks to facilitate a common
organisational understanding of the exposure to various risks and uncertainties at an early stage, followed by timely and effective mitigation.
This framework is reviewed at periodic intervals.

Market risk

The Company also operates internationally and hence, a portion of the business is transacted in several currencies. Consequently
the Company is exposed to foreign exchange risk to the extent that there is mismatch between the currencies in which it sells
and services, purchases from overseas suppliers and borrowings in various foreign currencies. Market Risk is the risk that changes in
market prices such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates will affect income or value of its holding financial assets/ instruments.
The exchange rate between rupee and foreign currencies has changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate significantly
in the future.

As a result, operations of the Company are adversely affected as the rupee appreciates/ depreciates against US dollar. Euro. GB
pound etc..

Sensitivity Analysis
A sensitivity of profit or loss to change in the exchange rates arises mainly from foreign currency denominated financial instruments
as mentioned below:
                                                                                                                                (` in crore)
       Movement in Exchange Rate                                                                For the year ended     For the year ended
                                                                                                  March 31, 2017         March 31, 2016
       Impact of 2% increase in exchange rate of USD INR                                                     (359)                  (441)
       Impact of 2% increase in exchange rate of EURO INR                                                         1                       3
       Impact of 2% increase in exchange rate of GBP INR                                                        (2)                     (1)
       If exchange rate is positively affected with decrease by 2%, profit shall also accordingly be affected.
Interest Rate Risk
Interest rate risk can be either fair value interest rate risk or cash flow interest rate risk. Fair value interest rate risk is the risk of
changes in fair values of fixed interest bearing investments because of fluctuations in the interest rates, in cases where the borrowings
are measured at fair value through profit or loss. Cash flow interest rate risk is the risk that the future cash flows of floating interest
bearing investments will fluctuate because of fluctuations in the interest rates.


Exposure to interest rate risk
Interest rate risk of the Company arises from borrowings. The Company endeavors to adopt a policy of ensuring that maximum of
its interest rate risk exposure is at fixed rate.
The Group’s interest bearing financial instruments are reported as below:
                                                                                                                                (` in crore)

Fair value sensitivity analysis for fixed-rate instruments
The Company does not account for any fixed rate financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. Therefore,
a change in interest rates at the reporting date would not affect profit or loss.
Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments
A reasonably possible change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would have increased/ (decreased) equity
and profit or loss by the amounts shown below. This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency exchange
rates, remain constant.
       Impact on Profit and Loss / Equity                                                       For the year ended     For the year ended
                                                                                                  March 31, 2017         March 31, 2016
       Impact of increase in interest rate by 100 basis point                                                (369)                  (350)
       If the interest rate is positively affected with decrease by 100 basis point, profit shall also accordingly be affected.
The risk estimates provided assume a parallel shift of 100 basis points interest rate across all yield curves. This calculation also
assumes that the change occurs at the balance sheet date and is calculated based on risk exposures outstanding as at that date.
The period end balances are not necessarily representative of the average debt outstanding during the period.
Derivative financial instruments
The Company does not hold derivative financial instruments.
The Company offsets financial asset and a financial liability when it currently has a legally enforceable right to set off the recognized
amounts and the Company intends either to settle on a net basis, or realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk of default on its obligation by the customer/ counter party resulting in a financial loss. The maximum
exposure to the credit risk at the reporting date is carrying value of respective financial assets.

                                                                                                                                       153

Notes on Accounts to the Abridged Consolidated Financial Statements

Trade receivables and unbilled revenue are typically unsecured and are derived from revenue earned from the customers. Credit
risk has always been managed by each business segment through credit approvals, establishing credit limits and continuously
monitoring the credit worthiness of customers to which the Company grants credit terms in the normal course of business. On
account of adoption of Ind AS 109, the Company uses expected credit loss (ECL) model to assess the impairment loss or gain. ECL
methodology depends on whether there is any significant increase in credit risk. In case of significant increase in credit risk, life time
ECL is used; otherwise twelve month ECL is used. The group uses a provision matrix to compute the expected credit loss allowance
for trade receivables and unbilled revenues. The provision matrix takes into account available external and internal credit risk factors
such as default risk of industry, credit default swap quotes, credit ratings from international credit rating agencies and historical
experience for the customers.
Credit risk on cash and cash equivalents is limited as the Group generally invests in deposits with banks and financial institutions with
high credit ratings assigned by international and/ or domestic credit rating agencies. Investments primarily include investment in
liquid mutual fund units, quoted bonds issued by the Government and Quasi Government organizations and certificates of deposits

Liquidity risk
The Company’s principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and the cash flow that is generated from operations.
Competative intensity has adversely impacted revenue and consequent cash accruals during the year. This, coupled with current
level of debt and imminent repayment obligations, has lead to stress on liquidity profile. The Company closely monitors its liquidity
position and is attempting to enhance its sources of funding by increasing cash flow generated from its operations and realisations
from other proposed measures.
Liquidity risk is the financial risk that is encountered due to uncertainty resulting in difficulty in meeting its obligations. An entity is
exposed to liquidity risk if markets on which it depends are subject to loss of liquidity for any reason; extraneous or intrinsic to its
business operations, affecting its credit rating or unexpected cash outflows. A position can be hedged against market risk but still
entail liquidity risk.
Prudence requires liquidity risk to be managed in addition to market, credit and other risks as it has tendency to compound other
risks. It entails management of asset, liabilities focused on a medium to long-term perspective and future net cash flows on a day
by day basis in order to assess liquidity risk.
Current and prospective liquidity risk is encountered when the Company is required to meet its obligations. The Company’s approach
to managing liquidity, that it will have sufficient cash and financial assets to meet its obligations and collateral needs, both expected
and unexpected, under normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses. Dynamic nature of the underlying
businesses necessitates that the treasury function ensures flexibility in funding by maintaining adequate working capital and its
availability under committed credit lines, for uninterrupted business operations. Existing operations of the Company are primarily
funded through long term loans. The Company is seeking to maintain/ enhance the level of working capital credit lines so that
operations are performed at optimum level.

Notes on Accounts to the Abridged Consolidated Financial Statements

Periodic budgets and rolling forecasts are prepared as regular practice and in accordance with limits specified by the Company.
51% of the total debt will be payable in less than one year i.e. during the financial year ended as at March 31, 2018. Apart from
this, there is an outstanding principal of ` 22,720 crore for the loans and interest as applicable thereon, payable to the lenders.

strategic transactions/ sale of assets, securitisation of customer contracts and rolling over of loans with existing lenders.

Note 2.21 (Note 2.49 of Annual Accounts)
Employee Stock Option Scheme
The Company operates two Employee Stock Option Plans; ESOS Plan 2008 and ESOS Plan 2009, which cover eligible employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries. ESOS Plans are administered through an ESOS Trust. Vesting of the options is on expiry of one year
from the date of Grant as per respective ESOS plan. In respect of the Options granted, the accounting value of the Options (based
on market price of share on the date of the Grant of Option) is accounted as deferred employee compensation, which is amortised
on a straight line basis over the Vesting Period. Each Option entitles the holder thereof to apply for and be allotted/ transferred one
Equity Share of the Company of ` 5 each upon payment of the Exercise Price during the Exercise Period. The maximum Exercise
Period is 10 years from the date of Grant of Options.
The Company has established a Trust for the implementation and management of ESOS Plans for the benefit of its present and future
employees. Advance of ` 387 crore (` 387 crore as on March 31,2016 and April 1, 2015) has been granted to the Trust and the said
amount has been utilised by the Trust for purchasing 2.13 crore ( 2.13 crore as on March 31,2016 and 2.13 crore as on April 1, 2015 )
Equity Shares during the period upto March 31, 2017. The fall in the value of these underlying shares on account of market volatility and
the loss, if any, can be determined only at the end of the exercise period under ESOS Scheme.
Amortization of compensation includes write back of ` 3,27,600 (` 13,09,300 as on March 31, 2016 and ` 2 crore as on April 1,
2015) based on intrinsic value of Options which has been vested under ESOS Plan 2008 and reflected in Statement of Profit and
Loss under Employees Benefits Expenses. No amount is chargeable in respect of Options granted under ESOS Plan 2009.

The expected life of the share options is based on historical data and current expectations and is not necessarily indicative of exercise
patterns that may occur. The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility over a period similar to the life
of the options is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.

Note 2.22 (Note 2.50 of Annual Accounts)
Employee Benefits
The gratuity plan is governed by the Payment of Gratuity Act, 1972 (Gratuity Act). The Company is bound to pay the statutory
minimum gratuity as prescribed under Gratuity Act. There are no minimum funding requirements for a gratuity plan in India. The
Company’s philosophy is to fund the benefits based on its own liquidity and tax position as well as level of underfunding of the plan
vis-à-vis settlements. The management is responsible for the overall governance of the plan. The management has outsourced the
investment management of the fund to insurance company which in turn manages these funds as per the mandate provided to
them by the trustees and applicable insurance and other regulations.

The Company operates its gratuity and superannuation plans through separate trusts which is administered and managed by the
Trustees. As on March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016, the contributions towards the plans have been invested in Insurer Managed
Funds.
The plan is in the nature of defined benefit plan which is sponsored by the Company and hence it underwrites all the risks pertaining
to the plan. In particular, there is a risk for the Company that any significant change in salary growth or demographic experience
or inadequate returns on underlying plan assets can result in an increase in cost of providing these benefits to employees in future.

The defined benefit plan exposes the Group to actuarial risk such as logentivity risk. interest risk and market (Investment) risk.
The following table set out the status of the Gratuity Plan as required under Ind AS 19 “Employee Benefits”:

      Sensitivity analysis
      Reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions, holding other assumptions
      constant, would have affected the defined benefit obligation by the amounts shown below.
                                                                                                                         (` in crore)

      Provident Fund : Under this scheme, the employee and employer each make monthly contribution to the plan equal to 12%
      of the covered employee’s basic salary. Contributions are made to the trust established by the Company. As at March 31, 2017,
      Fair value of plan assets is ` 235 crore (Previous year ` 270 crore), the present value of defined benefit obligation is ` 213 crore
      (Previous year ` 249 crore). For the year ended March 31, 2017, the Company has contributed ` 5 crore (Previous year ` 4
      crore) towards Provident Fund. The Employee Benefits as disclosed herein pertain to the Company and its significant subsidiaries.
      The assumptions made for the above are Discount rate of 7.52%, average remaining tenure of Investment Portfolio is 5 years
      and guaranteed rate of return is 8.65%.

Capital Management
Capital of the Group, for the purpose of capital management, include issued equity capital, securities premium and all other equity
reserves attributable to the equity holders of the Company. The primary objective of the Company’s capital management is to
maximise shareholders value.
The funding requirement is met through a mixture of equity, internal accruals, long term borrowings and short term borrowings.
The Company monitors capital using gearing ratio, which is debt divided by total capital plus debt.
                                                                                                                         (` in crore)

Increasing capital gearing ratio reflects reduction in equity on account of net losses incurred during the year and withdrawal of
depreciation/ amortisation of fair value of assets and loss on account of change in exchange rates from General Reserve as permitted
by the Court Scheme.
